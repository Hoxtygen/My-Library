# My-Library
This is a test practice to hone my web design skill.
This webpage shows a collection of some of the books in my library. This is not to show off that i love reading or lack of love for reading. I'm just using it to create something. after all we are told to just make a project to hone our skill.

As it can be found that the page itself is not perfect, it has many things yet to be perfected, it's an ongoing project.

An error i have found out myself and which i am yet to find solution to is the rendering of the page at certain screen size. I intentionally make the media screen max-width 800px as a feel good for now.
